# Shred Training Plan

This repository contains the plan for my shred phase spanning 12 weeks.
This plan trains each major muscle group twice per week.
It's designed as a simple and efficient plan for bodybuilding, to maintain size, but cut extra fat put on during the
off-season.

The sets are 12–15 per muscle group, with a rep range of 8–15 reps. 2 warm-up sets should be performed on each muscle
group trained.

## Routine

- Monday: Chest and Triceps, and Calves
- Tuesday: Back and Biceps
- Wednesday: Legs
- Thursday: Shoulders and Traps, and Calves
- Friday: Arms
- Saturday: Legs
- Sunday: Shoulders, Traps, Abs and Hips

#### Cardio:

- I do 20 minutes in the morning before breakfast if I can get to the machines, otherwise I usually do 10 minutes before
  each workout. You can adjust for your needs.

## Exercises

Perform 2 warm-up sets per muscle group, then each remaining exercise, do 3 sets with 10–12 reps. Once the muscle is
warmed up, you don't need to do warm up sets and reps again, just go right to heavy for your 3 sets of 12. I aim to get
12 reps, and no lower than 10, if I do 4, then I drop the weight enough to get the full 10 reps.
