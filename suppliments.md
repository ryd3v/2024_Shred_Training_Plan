# Suppliments

In the morning when I wake up, I have 500ml water with one scoop of BCAA's and one scoop of glutamine.

- [Allmax Essentials Glutamine](https://a.co/d/1N2pix2) 1 scoop
- [ALLMAX Nutrition Aminocore BCAA](https://a.co/d/heT6fek) 1 scoop

My first protien shake of the day to break my fast

- [ALLMAX Isoflex Chocolate](https://a.co/d/cmxIHoZ)

I use 2 scoops, and a scoop of almond butter, with 200ml of almond milk, and 200ml of water.

I prefer the [ALLMAX](https://allmaxnutrition.com/) brand, it's a great company, and they have high-quality products,
but
you can use any brand you want.
